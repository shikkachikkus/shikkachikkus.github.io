<h3>“The main reasons for floods have been assessed high-intensity rainfall in short duration, poor or inadequate drainage capacity, unplanned reservoir regulation and failure of flood control structures”</h3>

<h3>So a better way to resolve this problem is that, by creating a seperate way from dam to the sea,so that exceeded water from the dam due to rain can go to the sea and chances to cause flood can be decreased.</h3
