      <p>SEO stands for “search engine optimization.” It is the process of getting traffic from the “free,” “organic,” “editorial” or “natural” search results on search engines.Developing a strong website that’s easy for the search engines to catalog and index is all about following a few simple steps.There are many sites out there that list which on-site SEO elements are most important and what aspects you need to pay more attention to but this list will explain what each element is and how to use and implement them to your advantage. This list also offers ways to keep the on-site SEO user-friendly to maximize your results.</p>

               <summary>simple methods to optimize your web pages for searchc</summary>
                <p>
              <h3>1. Keyword Research</h3>
              <p>While it might be a dream come true, it’s not realistic to think that your site is going to rank for every keyword you could ever want. Many are simply too competitive, and a new website must do proper keyword research in order to find the right keywords. The ones you select should bring in traffic but also have an appropriate amount of competition.
              </p>
              <h3>2. Great content (the longer, the better)</h3>
              <p>Great content is now a requirement to rank well. Search engines rank pages with bad grammar and spelling lower. This means that sites with well-written content are finally starting to get the ranking they deserve</p>
              <h3>3. Natural keyword usage</h3>
               <p>The primary rule for mixing your keywords into your content is to make sure they sound natural to the reader. When you write for your reader (not to game search engines) and use natural keyword placement, you can actually rank better with search engines.</p>
              <h3>4. Page titles</h3>
              <p>Your page titles should have the keyword phrase you’re targeting but also be descriptive for the reader. For example, if your article is about “Labrador training,” then a good title might be “Labrador Training in Six Easy Steps.”

The page title should not exceed 70 characters. Although search engines will index longer titles, they will be truncated in the search results.

              </p>
              <h3>5. Header tags</h3>
              <p>It’s generally a good idea to include the keyword phrase in an occasional header tag, but don’t overdo it. If you’re going to include a keyword phrase in a header tag, it is best to use the first heading on the page (H1) because Google will pay more attention to it.</p>
              <h3>6. Optimized URLs</h3>
              <p>You can put keywords in your URLs, but don’t overdo it. (e.g., www.labrador-training-strategies.com/labrador-training.html)

This looks suspect, with an exact match domain and a keyword-optimized url. However, a branded root domain with an optimized url is fair game, like such: http://seoproleague.com/utah-seo. The root domain still has “SEO” in it, but it’s also a branded company.</p>
              <h3>7. Page load time</h3>
              <p>According to WebProNews, when Google added page speed into their algorithm, sites that had slow load times saw a drop in traffic from Google. Page load speed is a ranking factor for Google.

In order to fix page load speed problems:

Measure how long a page takes to load.
Optimize your website to improve performance.
If you are using a shared hosting server, you can try switching to a different hosting provider to see if it makes a positive difference.
               After making changes, measure performance again.</p>
              <h3>8. Internal linking</h3>
              <p>Make sure you link your content with other internal pages that would be beneficial to your readers. This will help improve your site’s SEO and will make it easier for your readers to navigate and find more of your useful content</p>
              <h3>9. Google authorship</h3>
              <p>Google authorship is easy to set up in your content and your Google+ profile. It allows you to establish yourself as an authority in your niche and as a result, Google will rank pages higher for your site.</p>
              <h3>10. Responsive (mobile) design</h3>
              <p>I recently read that roughly 56% of American adults are now buying smart phones and browsing the Internet with them. This is why it is critical that you use a responsive (i.e. mobile) design for your website so that pages easily show up on the small screen.

Google also recommends a responsive design because it makes it easier for visitors to have a single URL. Your web pages will load faster because your website doesn’t need to be redirected to another page for a mobile device.</p>

              <summary>Methods</summary>
              <h3>Getting indexed</h3>
              <p>The leading search engines, such as Google, Bing and Yahoo!, use crawlers to find pages for their algorithmic search results. Pages that are linked from other search engine indexed pages do not need to be submitted because they are found automatically.</p>
               <h3>Preventing crawling</h3>
              <p>To avoid undesirable content in the search indexes, webmasters can instruct spiders not to crawl certain files or directories through the standard robots.txt file in the root directory of the domain. Additionally, a page can be explicitly excluded from a search engine's database by using a meta tag specific to robots (usually <meta name="robots" content="noindex"> ). When a search engine visits a site, the robots.txt located in the root directory is the first file crawled. </p>
              <h3>Increasing prominence</h3>
              <p>A variety of methods can increase the prominence of a webpage within the search results. Cross linking between pages of the same website to provide more links to important pages may improve its visibility.[47] Writing content that includes frequently searched keyword phrase, so as to be relevant to a wide variety of search queries will tend to increase traffic. </p>
              
              <h3>White hat versus black hat techniques</h3>
              <p> SEO techniques can be classified into two broad categories: techniques that search engine companies recommend as part of good design ("white hat"), and those techniques of which search engines do not approve ("black hat"). The search engines attempt to minimize the effect of the latter, among them spamdexing. Industry commentators have classified these methods, and the practitioners who employ them, as either white hat SEO, or black hat SEO. White hats tend to produce results that last a long time, whereas black hats anticipate that their sites may eventually be banned either temporarily or permanently once the search engines discover what they are doing.</p>
